---BASIC SQL Fundamentals---
SELECT Statement is the most basic Statement
SELECT 'column_name' FROM 'table_name'
eg SELECT C1, C2 FROM 'table_name'
eg SELECT * FROM 'table_name'
***it is not a good practice to use a (*)

---Challenge One: SELECT---
Answer: SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer;
----Challenge One End---

SELECT DISTINCT(column)FROM table_name
***()doesn't need to be added. It is for clarity

---Challenge Two: DISTINCT---
Answer: SELECT DISTINCT (rating) FROM film;
----Challenge Two End---

COUNT() function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition
We can apply COUNT(colum_name) on a specific column or COUNT(*)
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT name) FROM table

WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions
AND, OR, NOT are the logical operators

---Challenge Three: WHERE---
1: SELECT email FROM customer
    WHERE first_name = 'Nancy' 
    AND last_name = 'Thomas';

2: SELECT description FROM film
    WHERE title = 'Outlaw Hanky';

3: SELECT * FROM address
    WHERE address = '259 Ipoh Drive'
---Challenge Three End---

ORDER BY is towards the end of a query. We want to do any selections first before sorting
SELECT column_1, column_2
FROM table
ORDER BY column_1 ASC/DESC
***ORDER BY uses ASC by default
eg SELECT store_id, first_name, last_name FROM customer
    ORDER BY store_id DESC, first_name ASC;

LIMIT command allows us to limit the number of rows returned for a query.
LIMIT goes at the very end of a query request and is the last command to be executed

---Challenge Four: ORDER BY and LIMIT---
1: SELECT customer_id FROM payment
ORDER BY payment_date 
LIMIT 10

2: SELECT title, length FROM film
ORDER BY length
LIMIT 5

3: SELECT title FROM film
ORDER BY length
LIMIT 5

4: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE length <= 50
---Challenge Four End---
